    description: "The Nissan ARIYA represents the brand's first dedicated electric crossover SUV, built on a new CMF-EV platform developed within the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance specifically for electric vehicles. The exterior showcases Nissan's evolved design language with a sleek, coupe-like silhouette, distinctive 'shield' interpretation of the V-motion grille that incorporates sensors for driver assistance systems, ultra-slim LED headlights, and a continuous light blade across the rear. The minimalist yet premium interior features a horizontal 'wave' dashboard with integrated dual 12.3-inch displays, haptic touch controls that provide feedback when activated, and a power-sliding center console that can be repositioned based on driver preference. The flat floor enabled by the dedicated EV platform provides exceptional interior space relative to the vehicle's exterior dimensions. Multiple powertrain configurations are available, including a 63 kWh or 87 kWh battery paired with either front-wheel drive or 'e-4ORCE' all-wheel drive utilizing dual motors. Power output ranges from 214 horsepower in the base configuration to 389 horsepower in the high-performance version, with driving range varying from approximately 216 to 304 miles depending on configuration. DC fast charging capability allows adding up to 175 miles of range in 30 minutes under optimal conditions. Advanced technology includes ProPILOT Assist 2.0 with hands-off highway driving capability, a head-up display, Amazon Alexa integration, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The ARIYA introduces Nissan's new semi-autonomous driving system with automatic lane changes and navigation-linked highway exit capability. As Nissan's second global electric vehicle following the pioneering Leaf, the ARIYA positions itself as a premium offering competing with electric crossovers from both mainstream and luxury brands, advancing Nissan's commitment to electrification under its Ambition 2030 strategy."
